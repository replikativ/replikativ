* Why?

** Data rules the world
   - most big IT businesses /control/, /own/ and /sell/ =data= (services)
   - /vendor-lockin/ into *DBs/Clouds/application-formats* are a form of
     /domination/ and hence /highly profitable/
   - most /important parts/ of the software stack are now available as
     open-source
   - /but/ more data than ever is /privatized/ in internet silos
   - APIs are an /abonnement/ to your & other people's data
   - somebody else can /apply statistics/ on you
   - but you /cannot/ and /will never know/


** Attempts from free software community

*** P2P solutions...
    - e.g. =GNUnet=, =Freenet=, darknet solutions etc. complect
      distributed system with privacy and cryptography \\
      $\Rightarrow$ scale badly \\
      $\Rightarrow$ /avoid data pooling/ for statistics
    - try to solve specific application-level problems in /a
      single-shot/, e.g. =Diaspora=, =Friendica=, =Twister= \\
      $\Rightarrow$ often /lack/ sound distributed semantics/theory \\
      $\Rightarrow$ difficult to change and adapt
    - single application through a sound combination of concepts,
      e.g. =bitcoin= blockchain, =ripple=
    - only read scaling like =BitTorrent=, =amule=


*** Backend solutions
    - very /mature/, /feature-rich/ space with countless products
      e.g. =Riak=, =CouchDB=, =Cassandra=, =Datomic= for the data-center
    - scale /very well/, some have well-defined consistency guarantees
      (many though have not, e.g. =MongoDB=, =Redis=, =ElasticSearch=,...)
    - help making the problem *worse* by improving the backend only
      and making the data silos more scalable
    - clients basically only consume views in form of web frontends


*** DCVS
    - most code versioned with /well-designed/ and /mature/ systems
      like =git=, =mercurial=, =darcs=
    - cooperation, e.g. through =github=, is very inspiring
    - can be used for data, e.g. =JSON=
    - but these force /line-based text-files/ in a filesystem
      structure
    - scale /badly/ with /binary blobs/
    - no general non-sequential data-structures like =dictionaries= and =sets=.
    - most data is managed in /mutable/ *places* like SQL
      databases/document stores

# it is often not versioned and cannot be distributed/forked, while
# the code is versioned and kept very safe


*** SwiftCloud
    - recent attempt to extend the cloud to the clients
    - data is partially retained locally, local writes are possible
    - but, has no data-centric approach, focuses on
      scalability+latency of cloud solutions


** What if...
   - one could /clone/ the application state?
   - could /share the application data/ and develop /different/ code-bases
     around it, while still sharing data?
   - one could alter the state anywhere and don't give up control to a
     single place under somebody else's control?


* Problem
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Eng ist die Welt, und das Gehirn ist weit,
Leicht beieinander wohnen die Gedanken,
Doch hart im Raume stoßen sich die Sachen,
Wo eines Platz nimmt, muß das andre rücken,
-- Wallenstein, Schiller
#+END_VERSE


** Distributed Writes to a single place
   - =CAP theorem= catches /tradeoffs/
   - /merging conflicts/ is needed in a /decentral available/ system
   - /distributed writes/ are well-studied
   - but /in practice/ often ad-hoc complected with state structure

# e.g. updates to different parts of the state can conflict semantically etc.


* Composing a solution: geschichte
  - nothing /fundamentally/ new
  - try to fit /well-proven/ concepts to the problem
  - develop with /browser/ first and don't settle on backend technology
    only $\Rightarrow$ cross-platform:
    - =ClojureScript= for =Browser=,
    - =Clojure= for the =JVM=
  - /journey/ of the last year:

** Starting with "git"
   - model state changes with =semi-lattice=
   - /well-understood/ API of =pulling= / =merging= / =committing= etc.
   - develop like a "native" app locally
   - tradeoff of /conflict resolution/
   - no networking is needed by developer \\
     $\Rightarrow$ easier development than current apps
   - but:
     - git has no concept of automatic distribution
     - some operations need to be manually synchronized
     - aborts on conflicts

** Partition global state space fairly
   - inspired by =Votorola=
   - every user has her /global place/ under her /mail/
   - /authenticate/ without central user-registry in the system
   - create /random ids/ for new repositories to avoid conflicts

** Peers
   - /no/ distinction between /servers/ and /clients/
   - =pub-sub= at core, middlewares cover specific aspects of protocol
   - peers can decide what their subscription looks like:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{user {repo-a #{"master"}, repo-b #{"foo", "bar"}}, ...}
#+END_SRC

** Peering

** P2P synchronisation with CRDTs
   - /well-studied/ data-types
   - *no synchronisation* needed
   - cannot express /all kinds/ of updates on data-structures
   - scale well
   - so, can we express /repository metadata/ as a =CRDT=?


** Metadata-structure
   - numbers are actually hash-uuids referencing values
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:causal-order {10 [], ;; root
                  20 [10],
                  30 [20],
                  40 [10],
                  50 [40 20]}, ;; two parents to merge
   :branches {"master" #{30 40},
              "merged" #{50}},
   ;; some constants + minor stuff ommitted
   }
#+END_SRC


** Is this a (state-based) CRDT?
   - only "downstream" op is /merging/
   - =causal-order= is a /growing/ graph without removals
   - branches point to /tips/ in this graph
   - /branch heads/ are a set
   - /remove stale parents/ through =lowest-common-ancestor= (lub)
     search
   - /multiple heads/ can /safely/ occur at /any point/ of propagation

** Propagation
   - propagation happens like a /wave-front/
   - at least once over all edges to /subscribed/ peers
   - peers need to be able to back metadata-updates up with
     values \\
     $\Rightarrow$ only accepted once /all data is available locally/ \\
     $\Rightarrow$ /no stale reads/ possible
   - all referenced values are stored under =SHA-512= hashes and hence
     cannot conflict, so the metadata CRDT solves synchronisation

** Commit structure
   - commits subsume an /arbitrary amount/ of transactions
   - transaction is composed of /source-code/ of a function &
     a /parameter value/
   - /both together/ give a description of the intent of update
   - allows linearisation of a database transaction log
     (e.g. Datomic/DataScript)
   - actual state can again be /composed of op-based CRDTs/ and hence
     have trivially mergeable transactions


** Current network: Scheme 1
   - /dumb/ pull-hooks
   - reduces "merge-bloat" on heavy load divergence, by /adaptively
     delaying/ merges and reducing availability (backpressure?)
   - server /pulls/ from anybody if possible into "its" repo
   - everybody *pulls & merges* from server repo into their repo
   - works, but /not yet benchmarked!/

* Demo


* Scaling
   - /divergence/: latency $\Rightarrow$ conflicts $\Rightarrow$ merge-bloat
   - client-peers only need /fraction of state/
   - mobile bandwidth can be /very expensive/
   - needs /hand-crafted/ design for application state like SwiftCloud

** Recent steps
   - plumbing
   - make hash-fn /~10 times/ faster on =JVM=
   - improve /kv-store/ and use /fast serialisation/ protocols
   - carry /binary blobs/ up to 512 mib with very low =CPU= overhead
     $\Rightarrow$ all application data could be packed in repo and
     /bootstrapped/ in client
   - improve /error-handling/ to comfortably use it from the =REPL=

** Next steps

*** op-based CRDT
   - calculating /deltas between states/ does not scale
   - encode all operations and merge similar to state-based approach:
     =new-state=, =commit=, =branch=, =pull= [DONE]
   - needs *in-order* /wire-semantics/ and /state-based/ total synch on connection

*** Decouple CRDT from replication
   - use protocols (type-classes)
   - replicate /arbitrary CRDTs/ under repository places
   - use CRDT /without/ this replication


*** Scheme 2 - "twitter hashtags"
   - /globally/ scalable
   - add (separate) CRDT with /mergeable/ transactions (without causal-order)
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:branches {["#erlang" #inst "2015-02-03T11:00:00.000-00:00" :1h]
              #{3 48 95}
              ["#open-hardware" #inst "2015-02-03T11:00:00.000-00:00" :1h]
              #{84 38 76 90}}}
#+END_SRC
   - let each user commit to her repos, pull all on server
   - similar to /SwiftSocial/
   - /partition/ branches by time to reduce throughput on clients


*** Scheme 3.1 - "banking"
   - each branch is an /account/
   - pull from clients as *multinomial* /in-order/, /stochastically/ in
     fixed frequency
   - the lower the commit-rate the higher the probability to pull if
     possible
   - clients have to /wait/ until commit is in server-repo
   - if not, client merges and retries
   - many operations still commute even though they could conflict
     $\Rightarrow$ server can /try/ to merge



*** Scheme 3.2 - "banking"
   - alternatively add "server-side" remote transactions like
     /SwiftCloud/
   - tradeoff is /direct communication/ becomes necessary,
     e.g. two-phase commit
   - high-latency clients timeout without commits, but don't introduce
     merges


*** Scheme 4 - "collaborative text-editing"
   - implement CRDT like "Logoot"
